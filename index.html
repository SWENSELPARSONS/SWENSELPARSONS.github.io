            Digital art allows for endless creativity. With just a tablet and software like Photoshop or Procreate, 
            I can create illustrations, animations, and concept art. It’s a versatile medium that blends traditional 
            techniques with modern technology.

            One of the best things about digital art is the ability to undo mistakes and experiment with colors easily. 
            Layering, blending modes, and brushes make it possible to achieve effects that would be difficult in traditional media.
        </p>

        <p>
            I enjoy using digital art for personal projects and commissions. It’s an ever-evolving skill, and I love learning 
            new techniques from online tutorials and other artists in the community.
